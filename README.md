# Atlasify

This repository contains a collection of open-source code around C2 Labs and our Atlasity product.  Each subfolder contains a separate project which includes:

- Integrations with third party systems
- Parsers for data ingest

## Purpose

As C2 Labs Professional Services or 3rd party collaborators create integrations with Atlasity, we intend to publish these integrations freely as open source for use by our customers.  In this way, we can continue to increase the value of Atlasity by leveragin the power of our ecosystem.
